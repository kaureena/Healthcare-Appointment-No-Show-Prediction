# Recommendations and business impact (V1)

## Intervention policy (starter)
- Low risk: no action (standard reminders)
- Medium: SMS reminder
- High: SMS + call attempt
- Critical: call + reschedule offer / transport support suggestion

See outreach flow:
- `docs/mermaid/v1_outreach_policy.mmd`

## Suggested KPIs for pilot
1. No-show rate (overall and by clinic)
2. Contact success rate (calls answered / SMS delivered)
3. No-show reduction in contacted cohort vs control
4. Operational workload (calls/day)
5. Complaints / opt-outs

## ROI sketch (template)
If average missed appointment cost = £X and outreach cost per call = £Y, then:

Expected savings ≈ (captured_no_shows * £X) − (contacts * £Y)

V2 adds monitoring dashboards to track these KPIs.
