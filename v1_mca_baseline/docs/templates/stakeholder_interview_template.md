# Stakeholder interview template (V1)

Use this template to capture requirements from:
- clinic operations manager
- scheduling team
- call-center team
- clinical governance

## 1. Goals
- What is the definition of “no-show” in current operations?
- Which appointment types are most painful when missed?

## 2. Current process
- Reminder channels in use today
- Rescheduling policy and lead time constraints
- Capacity constraints (calls/day, messages/day)

## 3. Decision levers
- What actions are feasible after a risk score is produced?
- What is the typical time window for outreach?

## 4. Success measures
- Target reduction in no-show rate
- Operational constraints and acceptable contact volumes

## 5. Risks
- Sensitive groups that require additional governance
- Patient communication preferences and opt-outs
