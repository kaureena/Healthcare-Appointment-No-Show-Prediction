# Project context (V1)

## Why no-show prediction matters
No-shows reduce utilisation of clinical resources and increase waiting times. A practical analytics deliverable is an **outreach list** (e.g., SMS reminder / phone call) prioritised by predicted no-show risk.

## Decision levers
1. **Reminder intensity**: SMS, WhatsApp, phone calls
2. **Scheduling policy**: shorter lead time for historically high-risk cohorts
3. **Overbooking buffers**: limited, risk-informed
4. **Transportation support**: for neighbourhoods with higher deprivation index (proxy)

## Success criteria
- Reduce no-show rate without large increases in operational cost.
- Deliver interpretable drivers and a defensible baseline model.
