# Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction (MCA — Project 2)

**Last updated:** 2026-02-10
**Data policy:** Synthetic data only (no real patient data)

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end **Machine Learning + Analytics Engineering + Monitoring** solution to predict **appointment no-shows** and operationalise the insights for healthcare operations teams.

It is designed in two tracks:

- **V1 — MCA Baseline (analysis + modelling):** EDA → feature engineering → baseline model → evaluation → insights & recommendations  
- **V2 — Modernisation (MLOps + warehouse + quality + monitoring + BI):** reproducible pipelines, DQ gates, SQLite warehouse, model registry, drift monitoring, API scaffold, and BI export automation

---

## Quickstart

### 1) Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2) Run end-to-end pipeline (data → ETL → DQ → model → monitoring)
```bash
make all
```

### 3) Optional: run the API
```bash
make api
```

## What you get

### Data & Warehouse
- Synthetic dataset with realistic no-show drivers:
  - lead time, SMS reminders, age, clinic, neighbourhood deprivation, prior no-show history
- Star-schema outputs and a local SQLite warehouse:
  - `v2_mlops_modernisation/warehouse/warehouse.db`

### Data Quality (DQ)
- A lightweight DQ framework with:
  - **90 expectations** in JSON
  - **36 documented rules**
  - HTML + JSON DQ reports

### ML
- A reproducible training pipeline that produces:
  - model artifact (`joblib`)
  - model registry CSV
  - metrics JSON
  - ROC/PR/Confusion Matrix plots
  - threshold tuning plot

### Monitoring
- Drift (PSI) checks (numeric & categorical)
- Freshness SLA checks
- API latency simulation + alert register


### Architecture overview
The modernised V2 pipeline implements a layered architecture:

RAW → STAGED → CURATED → WAREHOUSE → ML → MONITORING → API → BI

Components:

- ETL pipeline for reproducible data preparation
- SQLite warehouse for analytics and BI integration
- Data Quality framework for governance and validation
- ML pipeline for model training and inference
- Monitoring system for drift and operational health
- API for real-time prediction serving
