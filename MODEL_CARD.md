# Model Card — No-Show Risk Model

**Model name:** NoShowRiskClassifier  
**Version:** v2.0 (Modernisation track)  
**Date:** 2026-02-09  
**Data:** Synthetic data generated by this repository

---

## Intended use
Predict probability that an appointment becomes a **no-show** to enable:
- reminder optimisation (SMS/WhatsApp/Call)
- targeted outreach for high risk segments
- operational planning (overbooking policies, clinic staffing)

## Input features (examples)
- lead_time_days
- sms_reminder_sent
- age, age_band
- clinic_id
- neighbourhood deprivation index
- prior_no_show_count
- appointment weekday/hour

## Output
- `predicted_no_show_proba` in [0, 1]
- `risk_band` in {Low, Medium, High, Critical}

## Evaluation approach
- time-aware split (train on older appointments, validate on recent)
- report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, confusion matrix at operational threshold
- threshold tuning using F1 & recall constraints for high-risk outreach

## Limitations
- Synthetic data cannot reflect all real-world complexities
- Operational deployment needs live data contracts and feedback loop
- Fairness metrics are illustrative; in real systems, governance must include clinical + compliance reviews

## Ethical considerations
- Avoid discriminatory outreach decisions
- Keep human-in-the-loop for high-impact interventions
- Monitor drift and performance decay
