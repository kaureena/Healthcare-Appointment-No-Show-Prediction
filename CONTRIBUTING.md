# Contributing

## Principles
- This repository uses **synthetic** healthcare appointment data only.
- Prefer changes that improve **reproducibility** (scripts + tests + clear docs).
- Keep documentation links and screenshot references accurate.

## Local setup
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the full pipeline:
   ```bash
   make all
   ```

## Pull request checklist
- [ ] No broken links in markdown
- [ ] Tests pass (`make test`)
- [ ] No secrets committed
- [ ] Any new charts are generated by scripts (not manual copy/paste)
