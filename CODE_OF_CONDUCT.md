# Code of Conduct

This project is intended as a portfolio-quality learning repository.

We follow a simple standard:
- Be respectful.
- Be constructive.
- Prefer reproducible work (scripts + documented steps).
- Avoid uploading real patient data (this repo uses synthetic data only).

If you contribute, ensure any new data is synthetic and any documentation links are valid.
