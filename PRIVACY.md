# Privacy

This repository uses synthetic data only.

Even with synthetic data, we adopt privacy-friendly practices:
- no direct identifiers (names, phone numbers, addresses)
- no attempt at re-identification
- no sensitive categories beyond what is needed for ML demonstration

For real healthcare systems, a full DPIA / HIPAA / GDPR assessment would be required.
