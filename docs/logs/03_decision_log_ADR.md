# 03 — Decision log (ADR)

##### ADR-001 — Use synthetic demo data for portfolio 
--- Real healthcare data cannot be publicly shared due to privacy and licensing constraints.
Decision: 
--- Use synthetic data generated by scripts/make_sample_data.py for reproducibility.
Consequences: 
•	Enables safe public sharing
•	Supports reproducible testing
•	Synthetic patterns may differ from real-world data
Alternatives considered: 
•	Use real healthcare data
•	Provide no data

#####  ADR-002 — Adopt layered ETL architecture  
Context: 
--- Single-layer pipelines are difficult to audit and maintain.
Decision: 
--- Implement RAW → STAGED → CURATED layered data architecture.
Consequences: 
•	Improves lineage and traceability
•	Supports governance
Alternatives considered: 
•	Flat processed dataset only

#####  ADR-003 — Use star schema warehouse model
Context: 
--- BI tools require structured relational models.
Decision: 
--Create dimension and fact tables with KPI marts.
Consequences: 
•	Improves reporting performance
•	Supports BI and analytics
Alternatives considered: 
•	Single wide table

#####  ADR-004 — Use SQLite warehouse
Context: 
----Need lightweight, portable database.
Decision: 
---Store curated data in SQLite warehouse file.
Consequences: 
•	Portable and easy setup
•	Power BI integration possible
Alternatives considered: 
•	Use Postgres or SQL Server

##### ADR-005 — Implement data quality framework
Context: 
----Data pipelines require validation and auditability.
Decision: 
---Use expectation-driven validation and issue register.
Consequences: 
•	Improves governance
•	Provides audit trail
Alternatives considered: 
•	Manual validation

##### ADR-006 — Use composite appointment key
Context: 
----appointment_id alone is not unique.
Decision: 
Create appointment_key using appointment_id and patient_id.
Consequences: 
•	Prevents duplicates
•	Ensures uniqueness
Alternatives considered: 
•	Use appointment_id only

##### ADR-007 — Use time-based train-test split
Context: 
----- Random split causes leakage.
Decision: 
Use chronological split.
Consequences: 
•	More realistic evaluation
Alternatives considered: 
•	Random split

##### ADR-008 — Use Logistic Regression baseline model
Context: 
---Need interpretable baseline.
Decision: 
--Train Logistic Regression pipeline.
Consequences: 
•	Explainable
•	Fast training
Alternatives considered: 
•	Tree-based models

##### ADR-009 — Persist predictions in warehouse
Context: 
----Monitoring requires stored predictions.
Decision: 
---Store predictions in warehouse.
Consequences: 
•	Supports monitoring
•	Supports reporting
Alternatives considered: 
•	Store as files

##### ADR-010 — Provide FastAPI prediction endpoint
Context: 
---Need online inference capability.
Decision: 
---Use FastAPI with /predict endpoint to load model and return prediction.
Consequences: 
•	Supports real-time inference
•	Easy integration
•	Requires production hardening later
Alternatives considered: 
•	Batch-only scoring
